                        miHoYoMan was founded in 2021 by three BINUS University graduate students who shared a passion
                        for
                        technology and ACG (anime, comics, and games) culture. MiHoYoMan has since gone on to become the
                        original IP creator and interactive entertainment company that it is today.

                        In the future, miHoYoMan will continue to create more original products with a sincere
                        dedication
                        to transformation and technological innovation, continuing to pave its own path in the industry.
